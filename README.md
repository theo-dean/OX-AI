# OX-AI
An Artificial Intelligence agent that plays Naughts and Crosses, implemented in 3 different ways.\\\

## Brief
The goal of this project is to create 3 different Artificial Intellegent agents that are able to play the board game "naughts and crosses".
To demonstrate the ability of these agents, a simple web application will be developed, allowing a user to play naughts and crosses with one of the AI agents.

## Naughts and Crosses
Naughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) is simple game played on a 3x3 grid, by two players. One player plays as naughts; the other crosses. The players take it in turn to place a copy of their symbol in an empty grid position, the goal being to align three of the player's chosen symbol in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The game is won by a player, if they can align three of their symbol before the other player. Alternatively the game can be drawn if neither player aligns three of their symbol, and there is no possible sequence of moves that could result in either player winning.
